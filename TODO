TODO:

* Add a testsuite (preferably nose or py.test) which doesn't rely on a local jenkins setup (or instantiates one during test)
* Clean up the fingerprint code
* Clean up the resultset and results code
* Make all objects inherit off jenkins_base where that makes sense
* Add ability to add/modify/delete jobs
* Add ability to query jenkins for plugin data
